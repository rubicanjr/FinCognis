## Access Control Checklist

### Authentication

```typescript
// MFA enforcement middleware
async function requireMFA(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  const user = req.user;
  if (!user) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthenticated' });

  if (!user.mfaVerified) {
    await auditLog({
      action: 'auth.mfa.required',
      actor: user.id,
      resource: req.path,
      result: 'blocked',
    });
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'MFA verification required' });
  }
  next();
}
```

### Authorization (RBAC)

```typescript
interface Permission {
  resource: string;
  action: 'read' | 'write' | 'delete' | 'admin';
}

interface Role {
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
}

function checkPermission(user: User, resource: string, action: string): boolean {
  const role = getRoleByName(user.role);
  const hasPermission = role.permissions.some(
    (p) => p.resource === resource && p.action === action
  );

  auditLog({
    action: `authz.${action}.${hasPermission ? 'granted' : 'denied'}`,
    actor: user.id,
    resource,
  });

  return hasPermission;
}
```

### Access Review Checklist

- [ ] Quarterly access reviews for all systems
- [ ] Terminated employee access revoked within 24 hours
- [ ] Privileged access requires manager approval
- [ ] Service account inventory maintained
- [ ] API key rotation schedule (90 gun max)
- [ ] SSH key inventory and rotation

## Audit Logging Requirements

### What to Log (ZORUNLU)

| Event Category | Examples | Retention |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Authentication | Login, logout, MFA, password reset | 1 yil |
| Authorization | Permission grants, denials, role changes | 1 yil |
| Data access | PII reads, exports, downloads | 1 yil |
| Data modification | Create, update, delete operations | 1 yil |
| System events | Config changes, deployments, restarts | 1 yil |
| Admin actions | User management, policy changes | 3 yil |

### Log Format

```typescript
interface AuditLogEntry {
  id: string;               // UUID
  timestamp: string;         // ISO 8601
  action: string;           // 'user.login.success'
  actor: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    ip: string;
    userAgent: string;
  };
  resource: {
    type: string;           // 'user', 'document', 'config'
    id: string;
    name?: string;
  };
  result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'error';
  details?: Record<string, unknown>;
  correlationId?: string;   // Request tracing
}

async function writeAuditLog(entry: AuditLogEntry): Promise<void> {
  // Append-only, tamper-evident storage
  await auditStore.append({
    ...entry,
    hash: computeHash(entry),  // Chain hash for integrity
  });
}
```

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Neden Yanlis | Dogru Yol |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Logging PII in plaintext | Data exposure riski | Mask/hash sensitive fields |
| Mutable audit logs | Tampering riski | Append-only, immutable store |
| No correlation ID | Trace edilemez | Her request'e UUID ata |
| Missing failure logs | Saldiri tespiti zorlasiyor | Basarisiz denemeleri de logla |
| Client-side only logging | Manipule edilebilir | Server-side zorunlu |

```

## Incident Response Plan

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| SEV-1 | Service down, data breach | 15 min | Production outage, unauthorized access |
| SEV-2 | Major degradation | 1 saat | Feature broken, performance issue |
| SEV-3 | Minor impact | 4 saat | Non-critical bug, cosmetic issue |
| SEV-4 | No user impact | Next business day | Internal tool issue |

### Response Workflow

```
1. DETECT    → Monitoring alert / user report
2. TRIAGE    → Classify severity, assign IC (Incident Commander)
3. CONTAIN   → Stop the bleeding (isolate, rollback, block)
4. ERADICATE → Root cause fix
5. RECOVER   → Restore normal operations
6. REVIEW    → Post-incident review within 48 saat
7. IMPROVE   → Action items tracked to completion
```

    fetchSecurityScanResults(),
    fetchUptimeMetrics(),
  ]);

  return {
